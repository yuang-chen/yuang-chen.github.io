      <title>Multidimensional Subscript Operator []</title>

      <description>Finally, C++23 allows overload for the subscript operator [] to be multi-dimensional.
Before that, we normally either use:
vector of vector to form a matrix, and access it as mat[i][j] a class containing a big 1-d vector, but behaves as 2-d by overloading the operator (), e.g., mat(i,j) Now, with C++23, we advance the second option (which offers efficient memory access) with better indexing approaching as follow:
template &amp;lt;typename T, size_t R, size_t C&amp;gt; struct matrix { T&amp;amp; operator[](size_t const r, size_t const c) noexcept { return data_[r * C + c]; } T const&amp;amp; operator[](size_t const r, size_t const c) const noexcept { return data_[r * C + c]; } static constexpr size_t Rows = R; static constexpr size_t Columns = C; private: std::array&amp;lt;T, R * C&amp;gt; data_; }; int main() { matrix&amp;lt;int, 3, 2&amp;gt; m; for(size_t i = 0; i &amp;lt; m.</description>

      <title>Bitwise Op</title>

      <description>ðŸ¦¥ An old note.
Bitwise vs Arithmetic running on a vector of size 2^31, bitwise operations are significantly faster than arithmetic counterparts:
seg = 64; volume = (vec_size - 1)/ seg + 1; unsigned bs = log2(seg); unsigned bv= log2(volume); unsigned bbv = volume - 1; Arithmetic: out[i] = i % volume * seg + i / volume
Bitwise: out[i] = ((i &amp;amp; bbv) &amp;lt;&amp;lt; bs) + (i &amp;gt;&amp;gt; bv)</description>

      <title>Omp Parallel Region</title>

      <description>The results look suspicious to me&amp;hellip; But I wrote down this note many days ago ðŸ¦¥. Maybe I need to evaluate it again.
Multiple Parallel Regions The cost of constructing parallel region is expensive in OpenMP. Let&amp;rsquo;s use two example for illustration:
Three loops operating on a vector of size 2^31, e.g.,
for(size_t i = 0; i &amp;lt; vec.size(); i++) vec[i] += 1, vec[i] *= 0.9, vec[i] /= 7, Case 1: a large parallel region including the three loops by omp parallel { omp for }</description>

      <description>One of my old-day notes ðŸ¦¥.
Collapse of Nested Loops The collapse clause converts a prefect nested loop into a single loop then parallelize it. The condition of a perfect nested loop is that, the inner loop is tightly included by the outer loop, and no other codes lying between:
for(int i = 0 ... ) { for(int j = 0 ...) { task[i][j]; } } Such condition is hard to meet.</description>

      <title>Vector vs Array</title>

      <description>Another post recycled from my earlier notes. I really don&amp;rsquo;t have motivation to improve it further ðŸ¦¥.
Vector vs Array Initilization The Vector is the preferred choice for data storage in mordern C++. It is internally implemented based on the Array. However, the performance gap between the two is indeed obvious.
The Vector can be initialized via std::vector&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; vec(size). Meanwhile, an Array is initialized by T* arr = new T[size]</description>

      <description>Writing SIMD code that works across different platforms can be a challenging task. The following log illustrates how a seemingly simple operation in C++ can quickly escalate into a significant problem.
Let&amp;rsquo;s look into the code below, where the elements of x is accessed through indices specified by idx.
normal code std::vector&amp;lt;float&amp;gt; x = /*some data*/ std::vector&amp;lt;int&amp;gt; idx = /* index */ for(auto i: idx) { auto data = x[i]; } Gather with Intel In AVX512, Gather is a specific intrinsic function to transfer data from a data array to a target vec, according to an index vec.</description>

      <title>SIMD is Pain</title>
      <link>https://yuang-chen.github.io/posts/2023-04-25-simd-pain-intro/</link>

      <description>Writing code with SIMD for vectorization is painful. It deserves a blog series to record all sorts of pains I have encountered and (partially) overcome.
Indeed, once the pain of coding and debugging is finished, the program is lightning-faster. Nonetheless, I am here to complain instead of praising. Let me state why writing SIMD code is causing me emotional damage:
a single line of normal c++ code could be easily inflated to a dozen lines of code.</description>

      <description>The content of this post is extracted from my previous random notes. I am too lazy to update and organize it ðŸ¦¥.
C++17 new feature &amp;ndash; parallel algorithms The parallel algorithms and execution policies are introduced in C++17. Unfortuantely, according to CppReference, only GCC and Intel support these features. Clang still leaves them unimplemented.
A blog about it.
The parallel library brough by C++17 requires the usage of Intel&amp;rsquo;s oneTBB for multithreading.</description>

      <description>I am now a Postdoc at CUHK, and graduated from CUHK on Shenzhen campus for my PhD.
My research focuses on High-Performance Graph Processing on Multicore Systems, where the irregularrity of graph workloads are exploited to maximize the computing efficiency of modern multicore machines. I am broadly interesed in graph-related problems on diverse computing platforms, including CPUs (OpenMP), GPUs (CUDA), and clusters (MPI, RMDA). The core of my reseach is to investigate the interaction between graphs and underlying hardware.</description>
