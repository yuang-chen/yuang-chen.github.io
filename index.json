I am broadly interesed in graph-related problems on diverse computing platforms, including CPUs (OpenMP), GPUs (CUDA), and clusters (MPI, RMDA). The core of my reseach is to investigate the interaction between graphs and underlying hardware.\nSpecifically, I am looking into three types of research problems:\nBoosting generic graph algorithms on CPUs, e,g, PageRank, BFS, Triangle Counting, etc. Accelerating graph matrix multiplication (SpMV + SpMM) on CPUs and GPUs, which is a fundamental building block in scientific computing. GNN speedup. Also, I am a fan of modern C++ programming. I follow closely to C++20 and spent a lot of time in meta programming.\nIn 2018, I received my dual master degrees in Multicore Systems from TU Eindhoven, Netherlands and TU Berlin, Germany with full scholarship granted by European Union. In 2017-2018, I worked as Masterarbeitor (i.e., intern) in Frauhofer FOKUS to build Germany\u0026rsquo;s e-health infrastructure, based on which I developed my master thesis \u0026ldquo;Providing the Infrastructure for SICCT Protocol Tests with Focus on Service Discovery and Pairing\u0026rdquo;.\nIn 2015, I obtained my bachelor degree at Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST). Also, in 2014-2015, being sponsored by CSC scholarship, I studied as an exchange student in RWTH Aachen, Germany.\nMy CV is da.\nPublications YuAng Chen and Yeh-Ching Chung, “Workload Balancing via Graph Reordering on Multicore Systems,” IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems (TPDS), Vol. 33, No. 5, 2022, pp. 1231-1245.\nYuAng Chen and Yeh-Ching Chung, “HiPa: Hierarchical Partitioning for Fast Page Rank on Multicore Systems,” Proceedings of IEEE International conference on Parallel Processing (ICPP), Article No. 24, 2021, pp. 1-10.\nYuAng Chen and Yeh-Ching Chung, “Corder: Cache-Aware Reordering For Optimizing Graph Analytics,” Proceedings of ACM International conference on Principles and Practice of Parallel Programming (PPoPP), 2021, pp.472-473.\nYuAng Chen and Yeh-Ching Chung, \u0026ldquo;A Unequal Caching Strategy for Shared-Memory Graph Analytics\u0026rdquo;, to apear in IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems (TPDS).\nOngoing Work\nYuAng Chen and Yeh-Ching Chung, \u0026ldquo;Co-Design of Mixed Matrix Format and Processing Engine for Efficient SpMV on Graphs\u0026rdquo;, in praparation\nYuAng Chen and Yeh-Ching Chung, \u0026quot; Locality Extraction \u0026amp; Blocking for Graph Adjacency Matrix Multiplications\u0026quot;, in preparation\nTeaching 2020 Spring : Introduction to Programming Methodology\n2020 Fall : Operating System\n2021 Spring : Compiler Design\n2021 Fall : Operating System\n2022 Spring : Computer Architecture\n","permalink":"https://yuang-chen.github.io/aboutme/","summary":"I am now a Postdoc at CUHK, and graduated from CUHK on Shenzhen campus for my PhD.\nMy research focuses on High-Performance Graph Processing on Multicore Systems, where the irregularrity of graph workloads are exploited to maximize the computing efficiency of modern multicore machines.
